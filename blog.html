            <h3>My Journey Learning HTML and CSS</h3>
            <p class="blog-date">April 10, 2025</p>
            <p class="blog-excerpt">
              Learning HTML and CSS was my first step into web development. I
              started with simple layouts and gradually learned how to style
              them with colors, fonts, and animations. It was challenging but
              rewarding to see my designs come to life. This journey taught me
              the importance of patience and creativity in building
              user-friendly websites.

            <h3>Building My Weather App</h3>
            <p class="blog-date">April 15, 2025</p>
            <p class="blog-excerpt">
              Creating my Weather App was a fun project. I used JavaScript to
              fetch weather data and CSS to make it look clean. The biggest
              challenge was making it responsive, but I’m proud of the final
              result. This project showed me how to combine functionality and
              design effectively.
